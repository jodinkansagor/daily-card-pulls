# daily-card-pulls

Full Stack App

## Problem Domain: 
As a tarot card reader, I often pull a daily card. I would love a way to track card pulls as well as see trends over time. This app offers a simple way to catalog those card pulls.

## Stack
- Vanilla JS front end with simple component structure
- NodeJS / Express
- MongoDB / Mongoose
- bcrypt and json web token authorization

## Features
- simple sign up and login, with token/cookie persistance
- post input form takes in date, card, deck, category, and explanation of your reading
- list page displays all card pulls in reverse chronological order
- date range search as well as category sort

## In process features
- Moon phase on evening of card pull
- Larger spreads. Many people pull cards in larger spreads than a single pull. The feature would group cards together in a aggregate spread
- More comprehensive search capabilities. Search for a card, a deck, across multiple fields.
